# Haxe + Heaps Examples

I found the docs severely lacking for some pretty basic things when it came to using [Heaps](https://heaps.io/).

These are some really basic examples just to get you up and running

## Examples

### 1-moving-squares

Shows how to properly move a square the keyboard. 
Note the use of delta time so even on a low frame rate we move consistently.

Also not the use of a vector (`[0, 1]`) for movement instead of hardcoding player's `x` and `y` coordinates.
